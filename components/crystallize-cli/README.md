## Features

### Install a new project based on a Boilerplate

```bash
npx @crystallize/cli-next@latest install ~/my-projects/my-ecommerce
```

This will create a new folder, download the boilerplate and `npm install` it.

```bash
npx @crystallize/cli-next@latest install ~/my-projects/my-ecommerce --bootstrap-tenant
```

This will do the same as the previous command but it will create a new Tenant with clean data from the Boilerplate.

### Dump a tenant

```bash
npx @crystallize/cli-next@latest dump ~/my-projects/mydumpfolder tenantIdentifier
```

This is dumping a Tenant.

### Install a new project based on a Boilerplate
