# Crystallize Tools

Here are managed all the Crystallize Tools.

In order to simplify their maintenance they are all in this Git Repository.

All contributions will happen here:

- PRs and Issues are therefore open, discuss, contribute in one place
- Many things will be shared accross the `components`: Coding Standards, CI & Automations, Tests, etc.

âœ… Nevertheless, all the `compoenents` (here tools) will continue to be independant and pushed in their own repository. (through magic mechanisms that we have internally)

## Adding a new Component (Tool)

```

> If not already done, you still need create the Github sub-repository and add an entry in `components/manifest.json`
